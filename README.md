# üìä Data Analytics Project

## üß© Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow ‚Äî from raw data to actionable insights.
The process includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, visualization through Power BI, and presentation using Gamma.
The aim is to show strong analytical, technical, and visualization skills in transforming data into business insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps & Workflow

1. **Data Loading**

   * Import dataset using Python (`pandas.read_csv()` or SQL connection).
   * Verify structure, data types, and missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle null values, remove duplicates, and fix inconsistent formats.
   * Convert columns to correct data types.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Summary statistics and distribution plots.
   * Identify correlations and outliers.
   * Visualize trends using seaborn/matplotlib.

4. **SQL Querying**

   * Load cleaned data into **MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server**.
   * Perform aggregation, joins, filters, and analytical queries.
   * Extract insights like top-performing categories or customer trends.

5. **Power BI Dashboard**

   * Import SQL output or CSV data into Power BI.
   * Create interactive visuals: KPIs, bar charts, line graphs, and maps.
   * Design a clear and intuitive dashboard layout.

6. **Reporting with Gamma**

   * Summarize objectives, methodology, insights, and recommendations.
   * Present final visuals and dashboard screenshots.
   * Create a professional and clean presentation deck.
